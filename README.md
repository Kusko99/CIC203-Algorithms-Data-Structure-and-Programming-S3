# Algorithms and Data Structures Repository

Hello! This repository contains the codes developed during the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course at Mau√° Institute, instructed by Professor Machion.

## About the Course

This repository hosts the codes developed throughout the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course. Professor Machion provided instruction on fundamental concepts in algorithms and data structures.

## Contents

- **Code:** Implementation of algorithms and data structures discussed in the course.
- **Exercises:** Practical exercises designed to reinforce understanding.
- **Projects:** Larger coding projects demonstrating the application of learned concepts.

## How to Use This Repository

Explore the codebase at your convenience. As a student of the course, I've documented the code to serve as a valuable resource for reference and learning. Whether you're revisiting concepts or delving deeper into algorithms and data structures, this repository is designed to support your journey.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the course materials.

Enjoy your exploration of Algorithms and Data Structures!
